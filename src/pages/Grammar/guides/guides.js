For example, I could say, watashi wa John desu. This is how to introduce yourself. The desu, is pronounced des, and it is a polite way to end a sentence. When talking in the first person, most of the time you\'ll drop watashi wa, and use only B desu. When talking about others, you would swap out watashi wa, for the persons name. You can say, Yumeko-san wa nihonjin desu. This would mean Yumeko is a Japanese person. '

        body: 'Japanese sentence order is different than English sentence order. An example in English is to say, I threw the ball. The same sentence translated directly from Japansee would go more like \'I ball threw\'. Most of the time, you\' drop I, as when talking in the first person, the subject(I) is implied. So instead it could be \'ball threw\' to mean the same thing. The Japanese sentence would be, boru o nageta, or ボールを投げた'
