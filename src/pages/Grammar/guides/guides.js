        title: 'A + Wa + B desu',
        body: 'When you want to talk about what something is, you can use the form, A wa B desu. A in the example refers to the subject and B is an descriptor. For example, I could say, watashi wa John desu. This is how to introduce yourself. The desu, is pronounced des, and it is a polite way to end a sentence. When talking in the first person, most of the time you\'ll drop watashi wa, and use only B desu. When talking about others, you would swap out watashi wa, for the persons name. You can say, Yumeko-san wa nihonjin desu. This would mean Yumeko is a Japanese person. In this case, Yumeko-san is the subject(A) and nihonjin(B) is how to describe the subject.'

        title: 'SOV Sentence Structure',
        body: 'Japanese sentence order is different than English sentence order. The Subject comes first. The object is next and the verb is last.  An example in English is to say, I threw the ball. This structure is SVO. The same sentence translated directly from Japansee would go more like \'I ball threw\'. Most of the time, you\' drop I, as when talking in the first person, the subject(I) is implied. So instead it could be \'ball threw\' to mean the same thing. The Japanese sentence would be, boru o nageta, or ボールを投げた.'

        body: 'i- adjectives end with i(い), where na- adjective end with anything that is not -i. An exception to the -na rule, is when a word ends in ei. Words that end with ei are considered -na adjectives. \n I- adjective : kawaii （かわいい）-  cute \n Na- Adjective : shizuka （静か）- quiet \n Ei exception : kirei （きれい）-  pretty OR clean '

        title: 'ru-, u- irregular verbs',
        body: 'Japanese verbs have 3 classifications. -ru verbs, -u verbs and irregular verbs. Verbs can also be further divided into past tense and non-past(future and present use the same form). \n -ru verbs are verbs that end in -ru. -u verbs end in a mora other than -ru. An example of a -ru verb is 食べる(taberu, to eat). \n An -u verb is 飲む(nomu, to drink) \n An irregular verb is 勉強する(benkyou suru, to study). Even though benkyousuru ends with -ru, it is treated differently than a -ru verb. '
