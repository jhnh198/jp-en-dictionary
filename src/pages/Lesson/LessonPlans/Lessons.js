        body: 'The first thing to learn Japanese is to learn Hiragana. From learning how to read hiragana, you can start to read and learn Japanese. If we think about what hiragana is from an English sense, it would be the alphabet. Every hiragana has an associated sound, which is called a mora. Mora generally fall into a consonant and a vowel. So the sounds are comprised of two english alphabet equivalents. Exceptions exist in lone vowels(a, e, i, o, u). As well as 3 letter equivalents(chi, shi). '
